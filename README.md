sam-tail-http-file
==================

tail http file or tail https file with or without authentication

It's not a good practice, but sometimes there is no other way... (for example, when you can access to your log files just by a web server)

It's a netbeans project, you need a library

- libconfuse 


PS: the tar contains a binary compiled for x64
